Distance-Weighted Nearest Neighbors
===================================

[Distance-Weighted Nearest Neighbors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5408784) is an algorithm of classification, i.e., it is in the context of supervised learning, similar to KNN algorithm.

## Brief explanation

This method is similar to KNN, but the classification is based on a weighted average of the K nearest neighbors, in which the weights are based on the distances between each K neareast examples and the consulting point.

Look there are many different concepts of distance. Here we use the most commonly used: Euclidean distance.

## Example:
