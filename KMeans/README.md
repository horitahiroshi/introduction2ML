K-Means
=======

[K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is an algorithm of data clustering, it is in the context of [unsupervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

## Brief explanation

This technique uses a measurement of similarity, so the closer points form a group (it has a vies of creating [hyperspheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersphere)).

K-Means is very used to study the structure of a dataset in a context where there are no labels, so it is possible to associate a group by the similarity among each examples.

## Example:

Imagine you want to cluster groups of clients of a supermarket based on the time, value of money spent and type of products as attributes. Then in this space, by approximation/similarity, it is possible to find groups of clients with some similiar profile and suggest more associated products to each of them.
