K-Nearest Neighbors
===================

- classification
- supervised machine learning
- explain:
    - Space -> Linear Algebra
    - query point
        - verify which are the k nearest points
        - it is necessary the concept of distance
        - classes of the nearest neighbors -> voting
            - 1 person
                k=3 -> 1 A, 2 B -> resposta B
                k=2 -> 1 A, 1 B -> ??
