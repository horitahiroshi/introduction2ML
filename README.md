Introduction to Machine Learning
================================

This is a repository with implementations in Python3 of machine learning techniques, following the Introduction to Machine Learning videos from YouTube channel [ML4U](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKWX1jIoUZaWY_4zxjLXnIMU1Suyaa4VX).

In these classes the following subjects are raised:

Implemented:
- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](./KNN)
- [K-Means](./KMeans)

To be implemented:
- [Distance-Weighted Nearest Neighbors](./DWNN) (DWNN)
- Perceptron
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Naive Bayes
- Shannon Entropy
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Evolutionary Computing
- Hierarquical Data Clustering
- Statistical Learning Theory
- Bias-Variance Dilemma
